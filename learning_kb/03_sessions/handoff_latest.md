# Session Handoff (Latest)

Date: 2026-02-06

## What was completed

- Day 1 done: Godot installed, project runs with `F5`, Input Map created, `jump` verified.
- KB upgraded for long-term continuity (architecture, snapshots, indexes, backlog).

## Current learner state

- Level: Godot beginner from zero, strong C/C++ engineering background.
- Confirmed skills: project setup, main scene run, input action creation, debug script attach.
- Missing next: `CharacterBody2D` movement/jump implementation.

## Next session objective (Day 2, 2h)

Build minimal playable `Player` with left/right movement + jump using `CharacterBody2D`, then verify behavior in runtime.

## First files to read next time

1. `01_learner/current_state.md`
2. `01_learner/mastery_map.md`
3. `01_learner/gap_backlog.md`
4. `02_mentor/knowledge_map.md`

## Suggested first action next session

Start with a Day 2 2-hour runbook and create `Player` scene + movement script before adding extra features.

## Bootstrap Hint for new AI

If user says "continue", follow `AGENTS.md` at repository root first.
