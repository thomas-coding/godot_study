# Mentor Learning Backlog

目标：把“会教”升级成“可长期复用、可验证、可迭代”的知识体系。

## P0 (next 3 sessions)

- Confirm `CharacterBody2D` movement/jump canonical pattern in Godot 4.6 docs
  - Output to: `02_mentor/godot_core_notes.md`
  - Evidence level target: `Verified`

- Confirm `_physics_process(delta)` usage boundaries and pitfalls
  - Output to: `02_mentor/godot_core_notes.md`
  - Evidence level target: `Verified`

- Build Day 2 troubleshooting checklist (input, collision, gravity, floor checks)
  - Output to: `04_templates/`
  - Evidence level target: `Working -> Verified`

## P1 (next 2-4 weeks)

- Camera2D follow jitter diagnostics
- Scene organization and reusable architecture for small projects
- Save/load baseline pattern (`ConfigFile` vs JSON) for this project

## P2 (mid term)

- 2D graphics and math fundamentals for gameplay programming
- Performance profiling and frame-time budgeting in Godot
- Steam release engineering checklist with validation steps
