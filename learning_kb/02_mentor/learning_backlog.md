  - Output to: `02_mentor/modules/M05_characterbody2d_movement_basics.md` + `02_mentor/qa/`
  - Evidence level target: `Verified`

- Expand callback timing chain (`MainLoop -> SceneTree -> Node`) into reusable QAs
  - Output to: `02_mentor/cards/` + `02_mentor/qa/`
  - Evidence level target: `Verified`

- Build troubleshooting checklist (input, collision, gravity, floor checks)
  - Output to: `04_templates/` + `02_mentor/qa/`
  - Evidence level target: `Working -> Verified`

## P1 (next 2-4 weeks)

- Camera2D follow jitter diagnostics
- Scene organization and reusable architecture for small projects

- Grow `qa/` to QA010 for top beginner questions
- Prepare first cross-version migration drill (`4.6` -> target) using `version_upgrade_protocol.md`

## P2 (mid term)

- 2D graphics and math fundamentals for gameplay programming
- Performance profiling and frame-time budgeting in Godot
- Steam release engineering checklist with validation steps
- Source-level map for rendering and resource pipeline
