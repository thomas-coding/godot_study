# Current Learner State

Last Updated: 2026-02-07

## Snapshot

- Phase: Week 01 / Day 1 completed
- Daily Time Budget: 2h (today was temporary 1h)
- Primary Goal: Build and ship a complete game with Godot on Steam
- KB Baseline: Godot 4.6 (version migration protocol enabled)

## What Is Solid

- Godot 4.6 installed and launches normally
- `first_game` project runs with `F5`
- Input actions created: `move_left`, `move_right`, `jump`
- Debug script attached and `jump` action verified
- Versioned KB infrastructure is ready (`registry` + `upgrade protocol` + `compatibility matrix`)

## Current Gaps

- No `Player` movement/jump implementation yet
- No `CharacterBody2D` collision workflow yet
- No scene composition habit (`Main` + reusable sub-scenes) yet

## Immediate Next Session Goal

Implement minimal `Player` (`CharacterBody2D`) left/right movement + jump and verify runtime behavior.

## Teaching Preferences (Stable)

- Chinese discussion is fine; English answers on request with glossary
- Prefer actionable steps and minimal runnable outcomes
- Keep long-term continuity through local KB updates
