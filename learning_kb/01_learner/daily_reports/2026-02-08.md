Today Goal (English, one line):
Deepen mentor-grade Godot knowledge on signal dispatch, UI input routing, and pause-aware runtime behavior.

What I built today:
- Executed mentor self-study cycle #9 under Godot 4.6 baseline.
- Added M11 (`Signal` dispatch + `Control` input propagation + pause-aware processing).
- Expanded cards to K046 and QA to QA045.
- Expanded quick-answer map from 70 to 80 items (SQ71~SQ80).
- Expanded feature playbook from F035 to F040.
- Captured additional real build regression records (RRB-004, RRB-005).
- Built threshold baseline artifact (`rrb_threshold_band_v1.json`) from 5 records.
- Updated mentor dashboard from 60% to 66% and synchronized handoff/index files.

What blocked me:
- `--benchmark-file` remains unstable with longer iteration profiles in this environment.

English Summary (5-8 lines):
Today I continued expert-level mentor self-study instead of gameplay coding.
I focused on signal semantics, GUI event propagation, and pause-related processing behavior.
I added a new module and expanded reusable cards and QAs for teaching-ready support.
I grew the source quick-answer map and feature playbook to the next milestone.
I also extended release regression records from three to five real samples.
Then I generated a statistical threshold band artifact for repeatable pass/fail checks.
This improved both teaching speed and release reliability governance.

Top Terms:
- `CONNECT_REFERENCE_COUNTED`: 允许同一 callable 重复连接并通过引用计数断开。
- `accept_event`: 在 UI 输入链路中将事件标记为 handled 并阻断继续传播。
- `process_mode`: 决定节点在 paused/unpaused 下是否继续处理回调。
- `threshold band`: 基于历史样本形成的指标容忍区间（如均值 +/- 15%）。

Next step:
Resume Day 2 learner implementation (`CharacterBody2D` movement + jump) while keeping mentor KB updates incremental.
