Today Goal (English, one line):
Design a version-aware knowledge architecture for long-term Godot learning continuity.

What I built today:
- Added version registry (`00_meta/version_registry.md`) with active baseline and migration states.
- Added upgrade protocol (`00_meta/version_upgrade_protocol.md`) for trigger phrase driven migrations.
- Added compatibility matrix (`02_mentor/indexes/version_matrix.md`) for modules/cards/qa.
- Updated bootstrap/session docs so new AI sessions always load version baseline first.
- Added version metadata fields to existing mentor artifacts.

What blocked me:
- None.

English Summary (5-8 lines):
Today I did not start new gameplay coding.
I focused on improving long-term session reliability.
The knowledge base is now version-aware and migration-ready.
The active baseline is Godot 4.6.
I added a migration protocol for future upgrades, such as moving to Godot 5.0.
I also created a compatibility matrix to track what has been re-verified.
This makes future sessions safer and easier to continue.

Top 3 Terms:
- `active baseline`: 当前正在使用的知识版本基线。
- `in_migration`: 版本迁移进行中的状态标记。
- `compatibility matrix`: 记录知识条目在不同版本状态的表。

Next step:
Resume Day 2 implementation: build `Player` (`CharacterBody2D`) with minimal movement and jump.
