Today Goal (English, one line):
Design a version-aware knowledge architecture for long-term Godot learning continuity.

What I built today:
- Added version registry (`00_meta/version_registry.md`) with active baseline and migration states.
- Added upgrade protocol (`00_meta/version_upgrade_protocol.md`) for trigger phrase driven migrations.
- Added compatibility matrix (`02_mentor/indexes/version_matrix.md`) for modules/cards/qa.
- Updated bootstrap/session docs so new AI sessions always load version baseline first.
- Added version metadata fields to existing mentor artifacts.
- Executed mentor self-study cycle: expanded QA to QA007 and created Day2 troubleshooting/playbook assets.
- Executed mentor self-study cycle #2: completed M06, expanded QA/K to 010, and added source quick-answer map v1.
- Executed mentor self-study cycle #3: completed M07/M08, expanded QA/K to 015/016, and added performance/export checklists.
- Executed mentor self-study cycle #4: expanded QA/K to 020/021, expanded quick map/playbook to 30/F015, and added performance casebook + Windows preflight checklist.
- Executed mentor self-study cycle #5: expanded QA/K to 025/026, expanded quick map/playbook to 40/F020, and added release risk matrix + automated regression spec.
- Executed mentor self-study cycle #6: expanded QA/K to 030/031, expanded quick map/playbook to 50/F025, and added release rehearsal samples.
- Executed mentor self-study cycle #7: completed M09, expanded QA/K to 035/036, expanded quick map/playbook to 60/F030, and raised mentor progress to 56%.
- Executed mentor self-study cycle #8: completed M10, expanded QA/K to 040/041, expanded quick map/playbook to 70/F035, and upgraded rehearsal samples to real build records with artifacts.

What blocked me:
- None.

English Summary (5-8 lines):
Today I did not start new gameplay coding.
I focused on improving long-term session reliability.
The knowledge base is now version-aware and migration-ready.
The active baseline is Godot 4.6.
I added a migration protocol for future upgrades, such as moving to Godot 5.0.
I also created a compatibility matrix to track what has been re-verified.
I ran a mentor self-study cycle and added reusable QAs, cards, and troubleshooting checklists.
I then completed a second self-study cycle focused on Camera2D jitter diagnosis and source-level quick answers.
I completed a third self-study cycle on resource loading, frame budget, and export-time loading reliability.
I completed a fourth self-study cycle focused on release-ready diagnostics and deeper decision playbooks.
I completed a fifth self-study cycle focused on release risk governance and automation-oriented regression standards.
I completed a sixth self-study cycle focused on runtime settings pitfalls and release rehearsal evidence.
I completed a seventh self-study cycle focused on SceneTree orchestration, persistence boundaries, JSON diagnostics, and runtime viewport tuning.
I completed an eighth self-study cycle focused on scene-switch timing, timer execution order, JSON resource runtime behavior, and build-backed regression evidence.
This makes future sessions safer and easier to continue.

Top Terms:
- `active baseline`: 当前正在使用的知识版本基线。
- `in_migration`: 版本迁移进行中的状态标记。
- `compatibility matrix`: 记录知识条目在不同版本状态的表。
- `group call deferred`: 组调用延迟到消息队列执行的机制。
- `scene_changed`: 场景切换后可安全访问新场景的信号锚点。

Next step:
Resume Day 2 implementation: build `Player` (`CharacterBody2D`) with minimal movement and jump.
