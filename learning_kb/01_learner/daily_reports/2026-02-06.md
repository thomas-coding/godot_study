Today Goal (English, one line):
Install Godot and complete the first runnable project setup.

What I built today:
- Installed Godot 4.6 and launched the editor successfully.
- Created `first_game` and ran it with `F5`.
- Created Input Map actions: `move_left`, `move_right`, `jump`.
- Added a debug script to `Main` and verified `jump` action works.

What blocked me:
- Unsure whether Input Map setup was correct.

English Summary (5-8 lines):
Today I finished my first Godot setup task.
I installed Godot 4.6 and opened the editor successfully.
I created a new project called first_game and ran it with F5.
I added three input actions: move_left, move_right, and jump.
I attached a debug script to the Main node.
When I pressed Space, the Output showed that jump worked.
Now I am ready to build a Player node with movement and jump logic.

Top 3 Terms:
- `main scene`: the default scene loaded when running the project.
- `Input Map`: project-level action-to-key mapping.
- `is_action_just_pressed`: checks whether an action was pressed in the current frame.

Next step:
Day 2: Create `Player` (`CharacterBody2D`) and implement minimal left/right movement + jump.
