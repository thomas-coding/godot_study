Today Goal (English, one line):
Complete Lessons 7-9 in learner mode and refill upcoming lesson prep buffer in mentor mode.

What I completed today:
- Learner line:
  - Lesson 7 completed: added `Camera2D` follow and validated smoothing behavior.
  - Lesson 8 completed: refactored gameplay flow into one explicit state machine.
  - Lesson 9 completed: moved UI to `HUD(CanvasLayer)` and unified UI update interfaces.
  - Runtime checks passed: start/play/pause/restart/game over/win flows remain stable.
- Mentor line (triggered after class end):
  - Refilled prep buffer with Lesson 10-12 runbooks.
  - Updated queue to keep 3 lessons ready ahead (`Lesson 10-12`).
  - Synced trigger rules (`你备下课/备课`) and learner-first switching constraint.

English Summary (5-8 lines):
Today we finished three learner lessons and one mentor prep cycle.
In Lesson 7, Camera2D follow and smoothing were validated.
In Lesson 8, gameplay booleans were replaced by a deterministic state machine.
In Lesson 9, labels were migrated into a HUD CanvasLayer and UI updates were decoupled.
All core flows stayed stable after refactor and UI restructuring.
After class ended, we switched to mentor mode and prepared Lessons 10 to 12.
The queue now keeps three lessons ready ahead for continuous learning.

Top Terms:
- `mentor mode`: 导师备课轨道，只在用户明确触发时执行。
- `prep buffer`: 提前准备的课程库存，用于保证学习连续性。
- `state machine`: 用统一状态驱动输入与玩法门控的结构。
- `CanvasLayer`: 将 HUD 固定在屏幕坐标，不随世界相机移动。

Next step:
Return to learner line and execute Lesson 10 (enemy patrol + contact damage).
