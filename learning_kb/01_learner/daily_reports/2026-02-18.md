Today Goal (English, one line):
Lock the long-term dual-track governance so every next session follows a stable teaching process.

What I built today:
- Clarified project governance as a strict dual-track long-term model (`learner line` + `mentor line`).
- Added `00_meta/dual_track_governance.md` as the canonical governance file.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to include track triggers, default priority, and non-random class flow requirements.
- Updated `03_sessions/session_protocol.md` to enforce fixed learner-class SOP and mentor obligations.
- Added Day2 runbook alignment into weekly plan and handoff continuity notes.
- Synced learner state/mastery/gap documents so the next AI continues with the same rules.

What blocked me:
- None.

English Summary (5-8 lines):
Today we did not implement new gameplay code.
Instead, we stabilized the long-term governance model for this project.
The project now has a strict dual-track protocol for learner sessions and mentor self-study sessions.
The learner class flow is fixed and cannot drift randomly between sessions.
The mentor track now explicitly includes planning for the learner’s next class.
This makes handoff continuity much safer for any next AI session.

Top Terms:
- `dual-track`: 学员线与导师线并行且可切换的长期治理模型。
- `class SOP`: 每节学员课固定执行流程。
- `handoff continuity`: 下一位 AI 能无缝接管的交接连续性。

Next step:
Start Day 2 learner session with `00_plan/day_02_2h_runbook.md` and implement `CharacterBody2D` movement + jump.
