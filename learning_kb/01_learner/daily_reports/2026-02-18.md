# Daily Report

Today Goal (English, one line):
Lock dual-track governance and complete Day2 minimal playable movement/jump implementation.

What I built today:
- Governance side:
  - Clarified project governance as a strict dual-track long-term model (`learner line` + `mentor line`).
  - Added `00_meta/dual_track_governance.md` and synced `AGENTS.md` + `session_protocol.md`.
- Learner class side (Day2):
  - Built `Player` scene (`CharacterBody2D`) and instantiated it into `Main`.
  - Added ground collision (`StaticBody2D` + `CollisionShape2D`).
  - Implemented `player.gd` with gravity, A/D movement, Space jump, and `move_and_slide()`.
  - Runtime verification passed: left/right movement, jump, no red errors.

What blocked me:
- Ground is invisible in normal rendering because it has collision only; currently solved by enabling visible collision shapes during learning.

English Summary (5-8 lines):
Today we completed both governance and practical learning milestones.
First, we locked the dual-track long-term protocol for learner sessions and mentor sessions.
Then we executed Day 2 learner implementation using CharacterBody2D.
I created a reusable Player scene and connected it to the Main scene.
I implemented gravity, horizontal movement, and jump behavior in physics processing.
The runtime verification passed with stable movement and jump and no red errors.
Now the project is ready for the next step: minimal gameplay interaction with Area2D.

Top Terms:
- `dual-track`: 学员线与导师线并行且可切换的长期治理模型。
- `class SOP`: 每节学员课固定执行流程。
- `CharacterBody2D`: Godot 2D 角色运动体节点。
- `move_and_slide`: 基于 `velocity` 处理移动与碰撞的核心方法。

Next step:
Start Day3 pre-step by adding one `Area2D` interaction (collectible/hit trigger) on top of Day2 movement.
